#	Dual Horus Binary Decoder Script
#	Intended for use with Dual Launches, where both launches have 4FSK payloads closely spaced (~10 kHz)
#
#	The SDR is tuned 5 kHz below the Lower 4FSK frequency, and the frequency estimators are set across the two frequencies.
# 	Modem statistics are sent out via a new 'MODEM_STATS' UDP broadcast message every second.

# Change directory to the horusdemodlib directory.
# If running as a different user, you will need to change this line

# Where in the passband we expect to find the Lower Horus Binary (MFSK) signal, in Hz.
# For this example, this is on 434.290 MHz, so with a SDR frequency of 434.195 MHz,
# we expect to find the signal at approx +5 kHz.
# Note that the signal must be located ABOVE the centre frequency of the receiver.
MFSK1_SIGNAL=5000

# Where in the receiver passband we expect to find the higher Horus Binary (MFSK) signal, in Hz.
# In this example, our second frequency is at 434.210 MHz, so with a SDR frequency of 434.195 MHz,
# we expect to find the signal at approx +15 kHz.

# Frequency estimator bandwidth. The wider the bandwidth, the more drift and frequency error the modem can tolerate,

# Receiver Gain. Set this to 0 to use automatic gain control, otherwise if running a
# preamplifier, you may want to experiment with different gain settings to optimize
# your receiver setup.
